### Implemented features:
- open multiple links on one button press
- basic multi-tab UI framework for the extension

### Usage:
1. Click `Add Link` to add a link on the page for user inputs.
2. Enter a URL in the textbar, then, click `Open Link(s)` to open the given URL on a new tab (If there are multiple URLs, then, all of them will be open).
3. To delete a link, click on the `Delete` button next to the link.

### Issues:
  - Framework not functional in extension
