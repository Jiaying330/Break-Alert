Trevor:
  Source for creating todo list https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_todolist.asp.

  Branch contains:
    Todo List (not yet implemented with local storage; tasks are reset when extension is reopened and when a new alarm is set)
    Basic overall UI created by Eric
    Jiaying's Files implemented in Alarm section

  To add the todolist javascript, add todolist.js to the background scripts in manifest.json
  and add <script src = "todolist.js" charset="utf-8"></script> in the main html page.
